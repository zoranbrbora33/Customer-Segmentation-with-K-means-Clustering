# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

This repository contains files related to customer segmentation using K-means clustering.

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a common technique used in marketing and data analysis to group customers based on similar characteristics.
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for customer segmentation. 
It aims to partition a dataset into distinct groups based on feature similarities.

In this repository, I explore customer segmentation using K-means clustering algorithm. 
The goal is to group customers based on their annual income and spending score to identify different customer segments.

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

1. `customers.csv`: Contains the customer dataset with columns - CustomerID, Genre, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

2. `k_means_research.py`: Python script that demonstrates the research process of determining the optimal
number of clusters for K-means clustering using the provided dataset.
It uses the scikit-learn library and matplotlib for visualization.

5. `k_means_usage.py`: Python script that applies K-means clustering on the customer dataset to group customers into clusters.
It also utilizes the scikit-learn library and matplotlib for plotting the results.


## Results

The scripts provide insights into customer segmentation based on the provided dataset. 
By running the scripts, you can visualize the results and observe different customer clusters 
based on their annual income and spending score.
